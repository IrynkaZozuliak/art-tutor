                Since an early age I have been truly interested in the fine arts; sketching, design, painting and drawing. I am and have always been interested in life drawing and have spent a lot of time studying the human anatomy to apply this knowledge in my work.
            </p>

            <p class="about__text-color--gray">
                I am sure that everyone can draw and paint, and do it quite well.  Meeting different people and sharing my skills with them brings me more inspiration and satisfaction.
