                <span>32 y.o. Advanced</span>
                <p>Penny is always well prepared for the lesson. She gives clear instructions and makes the task interesting for me, though I'm an adult already, it's hard to surprise me with something. I'm always looking forward to the next class with Penny, and I really see the stunning results.</p>
