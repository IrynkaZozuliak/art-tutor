                    <p>Penny is very talented and great with kids. My daughter has been enjoying every class she had. Penny is really patient and sweet with kids. Very punctual and organized tutor as well! The classes are held in her own studio.</p>

                    <p>Penny is a well-prepared, thorough, talented tutor and she is able to adapt to different ages. Importantly for an art tutor, she is creative and has encouraged our children to develop their talents. Happy to recommend.</p>

                    <span>32 y.o. Advanced</span>
                    <p>Penny is always well prepared for the lesson. She gives clear instructions and makes the task interesting for me, though I'm an adult already, it's hard to surprise me with something. I'm always looking forward to the next class with Penny, and I really see the stunning results.</p>

                    <span>25 y.o., Beginner</span>
                    <p>I love doing Penny’s class. She is really inspiring, patient and very talented. I haven’t painted for years, so the tutoring has been helpful in removing my fear of putting paint on canvas! I’d highly recommend Penny for anyone!</p>
